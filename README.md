# Python_Perceptron
A simple set of files to reproduce the concept of Perceptron, solving the position of points relative to a given linear function, and combining 3 elements to solve the non separable XOR problem

# A Gif from the Points Example using Pygame:
Script runs over main.py - function can be changed inside Utility.py
Perceptron is trained one datapoint per frame, clicking the mouse left button triggers a training on the whole batch for one frame
